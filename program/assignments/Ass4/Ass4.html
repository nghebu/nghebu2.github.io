<h4>I do admit copy paste the html of the demo on icollege for the form of Q1 by using inspect function of the browser. </h4>
<h4>That said, the main purpose of this assignment is using PHP, which is not shown by any means by using this method, I believe what I'm doing is acceptable, because I'm still doing the main part (aka grading part) on my own</h4>
<h4>I did not do the samething for Q2 though. The answer is quite obvious: this assignment requires one full php, if I want to be graded proberly, I should at least do this part on my own</h4>
<h4>Did not use the given css for Q2, it is not necessary anyway ,as said on the task itself</h4>
<h4>And yeah I attached this whole and update my index, I'll still submiting 2 links though, one is this page, and the other is the main index, just to be safe</h4>
