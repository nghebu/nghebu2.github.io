<h4>I just make this page to include some of my notes actually, because the assignment already tell us to link the next part on the program itself, so only the payroll program should be enough to give you access to the rest of the game </h4>
<h4>the payroll should do as instructed, as for the other 2, I do admit I did not follow the instruction as close as I should (still close though). Partly because there's simply too much requirements that I afraid I might missed something, and This Assignment 5 is really harder that the previous assignments (aka my js skill is just so bad no excuses can help)</h4>
<h4>I'm aware of the spagetti code on the Picture Memory Guess. I spent quite lot of time messing around with css and some html5 new features, and at some point I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. I'm glad the program still work out though</h4>
