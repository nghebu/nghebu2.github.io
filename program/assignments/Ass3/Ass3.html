<h4>The Assignment said "Write a Program" on each of the part so figure I should just split all of the part into individual files.</h4>
<h4>Part 1 are random between 0 and 1 (50-50), so maybe you should refresh it to confirm the result.</h4>
<h4>Part 2 use inline css, I know I should always use external css, but for some reason I couldn't get it to work with php. There is no requirements regarding this anyways, so I hope this is okey. Aside from that, everything should be exactly like instructed.</h4>
<h4>Part 3 is pretty simple, so I don't think I would need to clarify anything here.</h4>
<h4>Part 4 is a mix between php and html so It is kinda hard to read in my opinion, but I did the best I could for easy grading. By the way, the php is sort by value by default, but I did make 2 sort like requirements: one sorting the key, the other sorting the value. I put some comment there, you can confirm it by going straight for the source code.</h4>
